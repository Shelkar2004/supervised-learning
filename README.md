-supervised learning is label of the data.
-Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset,
consisting of input-output pairs. The algorithm learns a mapping from the input data to the corresponding
output labels, allowing it to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. In supervised learning,
the goal is to generalize the learned patterns from the training data to make accurate predictions or decisions on new, previously unseen data.
